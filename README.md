Daily, weekly scheduler

## Daily/Hourly Scheduler
Here I have created an hourly scheduler webpage, which displays the current date and time. You can enter within each hour an event you need to attend or task
that needs to be completed at the appointed time.
The Curent Hour is highlighed in a red section, the past in grey, and future in a green section, to help keep things a bit more organized.
Each event typed in the hour or section that has been filled out can be saved by clicking the save button (floppy disk icon) on the right, which will save it to local storage
so as long as the page isn't closed it will be available.
